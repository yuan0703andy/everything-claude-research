# Research Principles

## Reproducibility
- All analyses must be reproducible
- Random seeds must be fixed and documented
- Data processing steps must be documented
- Version control all code and analysis scripts

## Honesty and Rigor
- No p-hacking
- Report all analyses run, not just significant ones
- Clearly distinguish exploratory vs confirmatory analyses
- Pre-register important hypothesis tests (when applicable)
- Honestly report failures and null results

## Literature Conduct
- Fair citation, including opposing views
- Do not overclaim novelty
- Accurately describe others' work
- Identify and cite foundational research
- Give appropriate weight to critical literature

## Code Standards
- Prefer functional programming
- Modules provide low-level functions
- main.py preserves clear research steps
- Function names clearly describe purpose
- Complex logic must have comments
- Avoid magic numbers, use named constants

## Writing Principles
- Clarity over elegance
- One main point per paragraph
- Figures must be self-contained (complete captions and annotations)
- Avoid exaggerated claims
- Acknowledge research limitations

## Data Handling
- Never modify raw data, keep backups
- Data cleaning steps must be documented and auditable
- Outlier treatment must have clear justification
- Missing value handling method must be reported

## Theory Development
- Hypotheses must be falsifiable
- Clearly distinguish hypothesis, prediction, and results
- Maintain theoretical parsimony (Occam's Razor)
- Identify theory's boundary conditions

## Review Standards
- Maintain critical attitude toward own work
- Actively seek contradictory evidence
- Conduct internal peer review within team
- Accept constructive criticism
- Do not cling to wrong views due to personal investment

## Ethical Principles
- Respect data sources and participants
- Protect sensitive information
- Do not manipulate results to fit expectations
- Appropriately disclose conflicts of interest
- Treat collaborators and contributors fairly

## Resource Management
- Reasonably assess time requirements
- Do not over-commit
- Promptly identify and report obstacles
- Respect resource constraints
