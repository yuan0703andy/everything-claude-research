# Hypothesis Archive

This file tracks rejected and archived hypotheses to preserve learnings and avoid repeating mistakes.

## Purpose

- **Learn from failures** - Understand why hypotheses were rejected
- **Avoid repetition** - Don't propose similar flawed ideas
- **Extract value** - Salvage useful insights from rejected work
- **Audit trail** - Document decision rationale

## Archive Format

Each archived hypothesis includes:
- **Hypothesis ID and title**
- **Rejection date and reason**
- **Domain-specific issues** (if applicable)
- **Evidence that disproved it**
- **Learnings extracted**
- **Salvageable elements** (if any)

## Recently Archived (Most Recent First)

<!-- Template for new entries:

### H-XXX: [Hypothesis Title]
**Archived**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Domain**: [stats-theory | policy-making | etc.]
**Status at Archive**: [Draft | Under Review | Testing]
**Elo at Archive**: [Score]

#### Rejection Reason
**Category**: [Domain Red Flag | Fundamental Flaw | Superseded | Infeasible]

**Specific Issue**:
[Detailed explanation of why this hypothesis was rejected]

**Domain Issue** (if applicable):
- For stats-theory: [e.g., "No viable lower bound strategy - problem is computationally intractable"]
- For policy-making: [e.g., "No identification strategy - treatment assignment entirely endogenous"]

#### Evidence Against
[What showed this hypothesis was flawed]
- Theoretical: [Counterexample, proof impossibility, etc.]
- Empirical: [Data contradicts prediction, simulation fails, etc.]
- Methodological: [Violates domain standards, unfixable design flaw]

#### Learnings Extracted
1. **Learning 1**: [What we learned that's useful for future work]
2. **Learning 2**: [Pattern to avoid in future hypotheses]
3. **Learning 3**: [Insight about the domain or problem]

#### Salvageable Elements
[If any parts of this hypothesis are worth preserving]
- [ ] Idea fragment 1: [Brief description]
- [ ] Idea fragment 2: [Brief description]
- [ ] Methodological approach: [If method is sound but applied to wrong problem]

#### References
[Related papers, attempts, or alternative approaches]

## Salvage Pile

Useful ideas extracted from archived hypotheses that could be incorporated into future work:

<!-- Template:
### Salvaged Idea: [Brief Title]
**Source**: H-XXX (archived YYYY-MM-DD)
**Idea**: [Description]
**Potential Use**: [Where this could be valuable]
-->

## Common Failure Patterns

As the archive grows, document recurring issues to avoid:

### Stats-Theory Common Failures
<!-- Will be populated as patterns emerge -->

### Policy-Making Common Failures
<!-- Will be populated as patterns emerge -->

## Notes

- Archive is permanent - hypotheses are never deleted, only marked archived
- Archive entries serve as negative results documentation
- Salvaged ideas should be referenced when used in new hypotheses
- Update statistics quarterly to track success/failure rates
