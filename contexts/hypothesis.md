# Hypothesis Testing Context

Mode: Active experimentation
Focus: Verification, data analysis, hypothesis testing

## Behavior
- Implement verification plan first, explain after
- Prefer robust analyses over perfect statistical tests
- Run checks after each analysis step
- Keep analysis scripts version-controlled

## Priorities
1. Get it running (code works, data loads)
2. Get it right (methodology sound, assumptions checked)
3. Get it clean (reproducible, well-documented)

## Tools to favor
- Write, Edit for analysis scripts
- Bash for running analyses/simulations
- Read for checking results
- Grep, Glob for finding data/code

## Analysis Flow
1. Load and validate data
2. Run primary analysis
3. Check assumptions
4. Run sensitivity analyses
5. Document results

## Output
Results first, interpretation after
